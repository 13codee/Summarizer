        listen to me very closely because youhave two choices when it comes to AI youcan either adopt it or you can get leftbehind but here's the problem with allthe news coming out about AI seeminglyevery new AI will be the next big thingthat will take everyone to the nextlevel but that's simply not true here'sthe reality of the situation most of theAI tools that everyone swears by willnot help you in any meaningful way Imean sure they're cool they're nice tohave but besides that they're not reallygonna help you nowhere's what I mean an AI tool shouldeither make you more money or it shouldsave you more time AI tools should makeyour workflow seamless not addcomplexity to them so in today's videoI'm going to give you the seven AI Toolsin order to do that now the first AItools that have the potential to makeyou lots of money and save you lots oftime are 10 web.io and durable.co nowback in the day creating a websiterequired a lot of skills and training Imean you need to be proficient inseveral coding languages and you alsohad to design everything and then youneeded to write each piece of codemanually and only then would you be ableto actually fill in a page with yourcopy I mean this entire process couldtake weeks sometimes even monthsdepending on the complexity of thewebsite it was a long arduous and mostimportantly expensive process and in thelate 90s even the most basic websitecould cost upwards of twenty thousanddollars then came tools like WordPressand later Wix and Shop Shopify and thesetools drastically brought costs down andall of a sudden most people could buildat least a very basic website but evensince these came out in the 2000s oneproblem has still remained time nomatter how you put it building a goodwebsite however simple will still take along time I mean sure nowadays you don'thave to code everything yourself you cankind of just put in whatever you wantinto a website builder but even then itstill takes time it takes time to getthe design right it takes time to writethe copy it even takes time to learn howto use the website Builders themselvesso much so that agencies and contractorswill offer to do it for you and let's behonest lots of the custom websites areactually just slightly improved versionsof basic Wix templates so that's reallyall to say that building websites isn'teasy and it isn't quick and that'sreally where AI comes into the picturewith tools like 10 web.io and durableyou can use AI to build your entirewebsite for you and I will design itbuild it write copy and even source andinsert the imagery and in a matter ofminutes you can go from having nowebsite to having a fully functioningand aesthetically pleasing website allyou need to do is give AI some basicinformation and that's it a few minutesanswering prompts if that and you'llalso be able to take advantage offeatures like built-in SEO and AIRecreation AI Recreation allows you tofeed the AI websites you like and it canrecreate similar websites for you now ofcourse once made you can edit whateveryou want and even have the toolregenerate the site until it's to yourPerfection and your liking so you caneither use these AI Tools in your ownbusiness or you can even startbusinesses around them you see tons ofpeople are paying Freelancers a fewhundred dollars to make really basicwebsites and with these tools you canblow those Freelancers out of the waterin a matter of minutes and even commandhigher prices while doing so these areperfect examples of how AI tools canboth save time and make you money nowover the years our attention span hasgone in shorter and shorter and creatorshave to grab attention faster and fasterand that eventually led to our currentreality where short form content is Kingnow there's multiple ways to go aboutshort form and I would know because overthe last year I've had 20 full-timeeditors full full-time strictly doingshort form content for me now obviouslythat's super expensive we have a fulldepartment for it we have a departmentlead and it's simply not an option formost people and that's where a tool islike Opus clip become extremely usefulyou see Opus clip is able to take anylong-form video and with one click turnyour long form content into short formcontent now the best part about thistool is that the AI is able to find thebest hooks in the video and piece themtogether with the relevant highlights topretty much cut out all of the boringstuff and that means that your chancesof virality are much much higher and theAI copilot also allows you to clip partsof a video based on keywords now this iseasily one of the highest Roi tools onthis list especially considering howprevalent short form content is and youknow as well as I the short form is notgoing anywhere tools like Opus clip cannot only save you time in editing andmoney in hiring but you can also build abusiness around it of course by now theindustry is no stranger to short formagencies but just because there areplenty of them doesn't mean that they nolonger work that means that tools likeOpus can actually make you tons and tonsof money and attract millions andmillions of eyeballs now the next AItool helps you save time and actuallysimplifies your workflow using chat gbtwriter now chat GPT writer is so simpleyet such a no-brainer and here's whyyou'll remember that when chat gbt firstbecame the Talk of the Town one of thePrime use cases for AI was to do simplewriting tasks but there's one slightproblem by the time that you get anemail open chat gbt copy and paste theemail write the prompt to read and replyto email you know once you set up allthe Fundamentals by that time frame itprobably would have been quicker to justreply email yourself and that's wherechat gbt writer comes in it's a simplechat GPT based Chrome extension thatalleviates all of that friction withusing AI to reply to emails it'sincredibly simple yet very effective insaving time in a longnow next I want to talk about tidio nowtidio's ai lero has the power to eitherassist or entirely replace your supportteam and doing all that whilst boostingsales on your website and obviously thismeans that you either save money byhiring less staff or make more money byproviding a better customer experienceand both of those lead to the sameoutcome which is more net income in yourpocket now tidio ai is essentially an AIpowered chat bot that can do two thingsit either replaces lengthy frequentlyasked questions and answers customersquestions in a matter of seconds so thatmeans that you can easily increase yoursite's conversion rates by making thecustomer Journey so much more seamlessbecause listen instead of clogging thewebsite with tons of frequently askedquestions and still having loads ofquestions unanswered you can now feedall of that information into AI whichcan then answer all of your customersqueries the AI can also answer moreadvanced queries like order fulfillmentor restocks by tapping into the databasenow the second thing the AI allows isfor human customer support team to workfaster and better you see here's thething tidio is a text-based AI whichmeans it can take your support agentsquick and rough replies and turn theminto full sentences that are on par withyour company's branding but if yourcustomer asks a question that's beyondthe scope of the ai's knowledge basethen it will automatically refer them toa human agent now here's the interestingpart lero can answer 70 of yourcustomers questions that means that yoursupport system can service more peoplein less time and as I said the result ishappier customers and ultimately moresales so the next AI tool will be usefulfor just about anyone and have thepotential to save tons of time now haveyou ever read through a seeminglyendless contract or some other lengthydocument now maybe you have to do somereading for a class or maybe you need toread some other brief or report for workwell well if you've ever been in asituation where you have to read a longdocument then doc you ask can save you aton of time because with Doc you ask youno longer need to read those longarduous documents you see there areplenty of tools that summarize text chatgbt can even do that but the issue withthe summaries is that they're only thatsummaries that means that you willinevitably miss important fine detailsbut if you know what to look for wellthen you can use a doc you ask becausedocu ask takes any document and analyzesit so you can simply ask questions aboutit in a chat box listen here's the thingextracting information from documentsliterally could not be easier so you nolonger need to spend hours and hoursscouring through documents you cansimply use AI now the next AI is onethat I've mentioned in a previous videobut it may just be the most useful AI onthis list and that's Microsoft'sco-pilot copilot directly complementsMicrosoft's entire Suite of productsthat means it's a able to do everythingfrom analyzing Excel spreadsheets tomaking full-blown PowerPoints I meancopilot can even transcribe notes duringa Microsoft team meeting and provide youwith a summary of the key points andaction items and even execute on theactions itself so let's say one of thoseaction items was to make a presentationcopilot is able to create a tailor-madepresentation to your desired brandingguidelines I mean we've all made aPowerPoint presentation before thatalone could literally save you hourscopilot also knows your calendar andtherefore can prepare you for upcomingmeetings it can even generate reportsand other word documents based onprevious work and of course it can alsoreply to all of your emails for youcopilot is one of the best examples ofAI making your workflow more seamlessand more efficient it's an AI tool thatanyone can take advantage of regardlessof their occupation and especially ifyou ever use one of Microsoft's productswell then copilot will be useful to youwhether you need to make a pitch deckfor your clients or analyze lastquarter's profitability co-pilot canhelp the last tool I want to talk aboutis Adobe Firefly because Adobe Fireflyis one of the craziest AI tools yet yousee most of the other tools on this listsimply save you time or money by doingtasks for you for example 10 web anddurable make websites for you tidioanswers your customers questions andthey basically give you leverageLeverage is really what makes AI sopowerful to begin with you see prior toAI you'd have to spend hours on a taskor spend money to hire someone to spendhours on that exact task now well nowyou essentially have an employee for afraction of the cost but Adobe Fireflydoesn't fall under that sameumbrella you see Adobe Firefly actuallyallows you to do things that otherwisewould never have been possible and inthe process of that this AI isincredibly valuable not only can youmake it make your work easier but youcan also make it a hundred times betterwhich of course will make you more moneyso let me explain how it works Fireflyis a generative AI powered contentcreation tool that means it can simplycreate things so let's look at threeexamples and how it can help you firefly can create realistic images fromdetailed text and this is incrediblyuseful if you need any sort of productphotography or any other scenario whereyou need to depict something nownormally you need a whole team ofgraphic designers and artists whereasnow you can simply ask the AI to do itfor you and that means you're able toelevate your work drastically withoutelevating your costs the second thing isFirefly has something called generativefill and that means that it can eitherdraw in or erase objects in a photo soif you want to wear a different outfitin a certain photo this AI can do thatfor you it can do things that wouldotherwise be impossible or would havetaken a Photoshop expert to do even thenFirefly does in a way that lookscompletely natural it can also turn yoursketches into photorealistic images andso much more so if you work with anysort of content creation Firefly will bea must-have tool both for easy fixes andfor exploring completely new ideas andsoon Firefly will even be able togenerate images from 3D elements nowhere's the bottom line This AIRevolution we're in is no different fromany other technological Revolution andas with any boom there will be aninevitable bust the key here is to beable to discern what's to stay and whatisn't and then to capitalize on thetrends that are here to stay and nowthat you have these seven tools to helpyou make money and save time all youneed to do is get to work and as alwaysI'll be watching from afarand I'm rooting for you
